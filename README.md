Designed an NLP-based spam detection system using Naive Bayes, LSTM, and Transformer-based models, comparing performance across TF-IDF, BoW and combined into a hybrid ensemble model of accuracy 95%
Preprocessed data with tokenization, lowercasing, stopword removal, regex filtering to improve feature quality.
Applied Laplace smoothing to handle zero-probability issues for unseen words, optimizing model robustness.
